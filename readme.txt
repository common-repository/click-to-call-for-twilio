== Description ==

This Twilio plugin enables your website visitors to enter their mobile numbers and to be directed instantly to your Twilio endpoint numbers using voice or SMS/MMS actions. You need to configure yourself the incoming routes for both voice and text in your Twilio dashboard. The plugin comes with flexible shortcodes to add the widget anywhere on your WP website.

Simply put, this Twilio Plugin is a connector between your WordPress website and your Twilio numbers. We know that visitors don't like to fill in long and intrusive contact forms, that is why we believe this is a great addition for those who need to decrease their interaction time with the website visitors and to grow their lead generation. With just a single phone input you can get connected to support, sales reps in less than 5 seconds! You can also use plugin's SMS/MMS shortcodes to send your website visitors promotions, specials, directions, instructions or anything you like - directly on their mobile phones. 

In order to get Click-to-Call for Twilio to work, you need to add your Twilio ACCOUNT SID and AUTH TOKEN. Basically these are the keys that will grant plugin access to your Twilio Cloud Infrastructure and will help to initiate voice or text actions.

If you don’t have a Twilio account don’t worry, setting up an account is very simple and you can get your trial credentials in a matter of seconds. You can find a very comprehensive video tutorial [here](https://twilio.dasweb.ca/general-settings/).

<h3>Obtaining the Twilio SID and AUTH tokens</h3>

After you have your Twilio account set up navigate to your main [Twilio Dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/console) and copy your credentials into the general settings of the plugin.

<h3>Adding a Click-to-Call shortcode</h3>

To add a shortcode of your Click-to-Call button simply add the following to any part of your WordPress page or visual editor:

<pre><code>[twtcall label='Click To Call' number='+1501222333']</code></pre>
Notice that by default the label for the button is ‘Click to Call’ which you can change to whatever is the best for you. The second part of the shortcode is the default Voice number that you set up in the Settings page. You can overwrite it with another Voice capable number that you have in your Twilio account.
